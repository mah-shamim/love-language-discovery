**What I Built**

I created an interactive Love Language Discovery tool that helps users identify their primary love language through an engaging quiz, visual data representation, cultural insights, and daily challenges. The application features:

- **Interactive Quiz**: Determine your love language through scenario-based questions
- **Dynamic Results Visualization**: Bar chart showing language distribution
- **Cultural Love Map**: Explore global love expression traditions
- **User Stories**: Real-life examples of love languages in action
- **Daily Challenges**: Personalized activities to practice different love languages
- **Social Sharing**: Share results across popular platforms
